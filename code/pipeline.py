# Read in input features
# Train neural net
# --> optimize loss function (params W,b,etc and hyperparams learning rate, reg strength)
# --> plot loss over time
# --> save params for NN
# Predict on validation set (accuracy)

# Usage: options like -tr -pr test.pickle (which mean train, predict, input features file)
